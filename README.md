# Task Management

## What is the Service?

This service is a Jira-like project management application. It allows users to create, manage, and track tasks. Tasks can have both static fields (e.g., name, description, status) and custom fields of different types.

## How Does It Work?

This service is built with FastAPI, a modern Python web framework. It provides a RESTful API for creating, updating, and retrieving tasks. MongoDB is used as the database for storing tasks. Users can interact with the service using API requests.

## How to Install and Use It

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/johnPractice/task-management.git
   cd task-management
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python app.main.py
   
   ```
   or
   ```
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```
Service will be accessible at http://localhost:8000.

## Why Use MongoDB as the Database?

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that is well-suited for projects like this where the data structure may change over time, such as with custom fields for tasks. It allows for flexibility and scalability in handling large datasets. However, the choice of the database depends on your specific requirements and constraints.

## How to should handle 
Handling 1 million task records in a FastAPI project with good performance involves optimizing various aspects of your application, including database queries, API endpoints, and deployment. Here are some strategies to achieve good performance:

### Database Indexing:

1. **Indexing Fields:** Ensure that fields used for filtering and searching, especially those in your query conditions (e.g., `name`, `status`), are indexed. Indexing can significantly speed up read operations.

2. **Avoiding Full Scans:** Use indexed fields in your queries to avoid full scans of the database. This becomes crucial as the number of records increases.

### Pagination:

Implement pagination in your API responses. Instead of returning all 1 million records in a single response, break them into smaller chunks using page numbers or cursor-based pagination. This reduces the load on both the server and the client.

### Caching:

Consider implementing caching mechanisms, especially for read-heavy operations. Cache frequently accessed data to reduce the load on the database.

### Asynchronous Operations:

Leverage FastAPI's support for asynchronous programming. This is particularly useful for I/O-bound operations, such as database queries, where you can use `async` and `await` to handle concurrent requests efficiently.

### Load Balancing:

If your application is deployed in a production environment, consider using load balancing to distribute incoming requests among multiple server instances. This helps handle a large number of concurrent connections.

### Sharding:

If your dataset continues to grow, consider database sharding. Sharding involves horizontally partitioning your data across multiple databases or servers. This can improve both read and write performance.

### Data Archiving:

If historical data is less frequently accessed, consider archiving older records to a different storage or database. This keeps your active dataset smaller and improves query performance.

### Denormalization:

Depending on your use case, consider denormalizing your data for read-heavy operations. This involves duplicating data to avoid joins, which can be costly in terms of performance.

### Use Efficient Query Methods:

Leverage the specific query methods provided by your database. For MongoDB, this includes using the `$in` operator for querying multiple values at once and ensuring efficient use of indexes.


## Next Step
For next step can add :
- Add Schema to mongodb collections for having more safty and data consistency
- User Authentication.
- Add user permissions role that contains do not access to every user for create, update or delete tasks or just modify own task.
- Add caching for API response and query on database with using <b>Redis</b>.
